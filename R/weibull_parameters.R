#' Predict Weibull Parameters for Edge Weight Distributions
#'
#' @description
#' Predicts the shape and scale parameters of a Weibull distribution that
#' characterizes the absolute partial correlation edge weights of a psychometric
#' network, given its number of nodes and sample size. Parameter estimates are
#' derived from a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model fitted to empirical
#' network data from Huth et al. (2025), where absolute partial correlations were
#' found to follow a Weibull distribution more consistently than Beta, Gamma, or
#' log-normal alternatives.
#'
#' @param nodes Integer. The number of nodes (variables) in the network.
#' Must be between 8 and 40, reflecting the range of the empirical networks
#' used to fit the underlying SUR model.
#'
#' @param sample_size Integer. The sample size of the dataset from which the
#' network is estimated.
#'
#' @param snr Numeric (length = 1).
#' Signal-to-noise ratio of partial correlations (\eqn{\bar{|w|} / \mathrm{SD}(|w|)}).
#' Values less than 1 indicate wider range of partial correlations (\eqn{w}) whereas
#' values greater than 1 indicate narrower range.
#' Defaults to \code{1} where the mean of the partial correlations (\eqn{\bar{|w|}})
#' is equal to the standard deviation (\eqn{\mathrm{SD}(|w|)})
#'
#' @param bootstrap Logical. If \code{TRUE}, a randomly sampled residual from
#' the SUR model fit is added to each predicted parameter, introducing
#' empirically grounded variability suitable for use in simulation or
#' bootstrapping contexts. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
#'
#' @details
#' The shape and scale parameters are predicted from derived network descriptors
#' that differ between the two SUR equations:
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{rlp}}{The reciprocal log of the number of nodes,
#'     \eqn{1 / \log(p)}, capturing the diminishing marginal effect of network
#'     size on edge weight distributions. Used in both the shape and scale
#'     equations.}
#'   \item{\code{scaling}}{The standard error of partial correlations defined as
#'     \eqn{\sqrt{1 / (n - p - 2)}}, where \eqn{n} is the sample size and
#'     \eqn{p} is the number of nodes. Larger values indicate greater sampling
#'     uncertainty in the partial correlation estimates. Used in the scale
#'     equation only.}
#' }
#'
#' The two SUR equations have an asymmetric structure reflecting different
#' theoretical roles for sampling precision. Shape — which governs the
#' concentration of the edge weight distribution — is determined solely by
#' signal characteristics of the network via \code{snr} and \code{rlp}.
#' Scale — which governs the typical magnitude of edge weights — additionally
#' depends on \code{scaling}, as the expected size of partial correlations is
#' directly affected by estimation precision. This asymmetry is both
#' empirically supported (dropping \code{scaling} from the shape equation
#' costs \eqn{\Delta R^2 < 0.006}) and theoretically coherent.
#'
#' These predictors enter two SUR equations whose coefficients are stored in
#' the internal \code{weibull_weights} dataset. SUR was used to account for the
#' correlated residuals between the shape and scale equations across networks
#' (residual correlation = 0.261). Model fit was strong: the shape equation
#' achieved \eqn{R^2 = 0.887} (RMSE = 0.048) and the scale equation achieved
#' \eqn{R^2 = 0.885} (RMSE = 0.011). Shape residuals were normally distributed
#' (Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.990, p = 0.173). Scale residuals showed a modest
#' departure from normality (Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.973, p < 0.001), consistent
#' with slight right skew in the scale outcome and test sensitivity at n = 194
#' rather than a substantive violation. Heteroskedasticity was detected in both
#' the shape equation (Breusch-Pagan p < 0.001) and the scale equation
#' (Breusch-Pagan p < 0.001); robust standard errors (HC3) were used for
#' inference. Multicollinearity among predictors in the scale equation was
#' negligible (VIF \eqn{\leq} 1.60); the shape equation contains only two
#' predictors with no multicollinearity concern.
#'
#' \code{nodes} influences predicted shape and scale via \code{rlp}.
#' \code{sample_size} influences predicted scale via \code{scaling}, and
#' both parameters via their joint contribution to \code{snr} when it is
#' estimated from data rather than supplied directly.
#'
#' Empirically, shape values ranged from approximately 0.72 to 1.63
#' (M = 1.07, SD = 0.14) and scale values from approximately 0.03 to 0.19
#' (M = 0.10, SD = 0.03) across the 194 networks used to fit the model. Shape
#' values near 1 indicate approximately exponential edge weight distributions;
#' values above 1 indicate a rising hazard (mode-bearing distribution).
#'
#' When \code{bootstrap = TRUE}, residuals are drawn via \code{shuffle()} --
#' a random sampling without replacement -- from the empirical SUR residuals,
#' preserving the observed marginal residual distribution.
