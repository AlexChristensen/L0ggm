#' SUR Model Coefficients and Residuals for Weibull Parameter Prediction
#'
#' A named list encoding the Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model fitted
#' to Weibull shape and scale parameters derived from 194
#' empirical networks. The object is consumed internally by \code{\link{weibull_parameters}}
#' to generate data-driven Weibull parameter estimates given a network's
#' number of nodes and sample size.

#'
#' @format A named list with two elements, \code{shape} and \code{scale},
#' each containing:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{coefficients}}{A named numeric vector of regression
#'   coefficients from the SUR model. The equations are asymmetric: the shape
#'   equation includes an intercept and two predictors (\code{snr}, \code{rlp});
#'   the scale equation includes an intercept and three predictors
#'   (\code{snr}, \code{rlp}, \code{scaling}).
#'   Predictors are defined as follows:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{\code{snr}}{Signal-to-noise ratio of the absolute partial
#'     correlations, computed as the mean divided by the standard deviation
#'     of the absolute edge weights. Used in both equations.}
#'     \item{\code{rlp}}{Reciprocal log of node count, \eqn{1 / \log(p)},
#'     where \eqn{p} is the number of nodes. Used in both equations.}
#'     \item{\code{scaling}}{Standard error of partial correlations,
#'     \eqn{\sqrt{1 / (n - p - 2)}}, where \eqn{n} is the sample size and
#'     \eqn{p} is the number of nodes. Used in the scale equation only.}
#'   }}
#'   \item{\code{residuals}}{A numeric vector of residuals from the fitted SUR
#'   equation, used by \code{\link{weibull_parameters}} to introduce
#'   empirically grounded variability when \code{bootstrap = TRUE}.}

#' @details
#' Absolute partial correlations from 222 deduplicated empirical networks
#' (Huth et al., 2025) were fitted to Beta, Gamma, log-normal, and Weibull
#' distributions via maximum likelihood. Weibull provided the best fit most
#' consistently: it outperformed each alternative by more than 2 log-likelihood
#' units far more often than the reverse (vs. Beta: 56--0; vs. Gamma: 15--2;
#' vs. log-normal: 155--13; vs. Exponential: 54--0).
#'
#' The resulting Weibull shape and scale parameters were then jointly modelled
#' as a function of network descriptors using Seemingly Unrelated Regression
#' (\code{systemfit}), which accounts for correlated residuals between the
#' shape and scale equations across networks (residual correlation = 0.261).
#' Prior to fitting, networks with fewer than eight nodes (\eqn{p < 8}), more
#' than 300,000 observations, or fewer than one observation per edge
#' (\eqn{\text{ope} \leq 1}) were excluded, as Huth et al. (2025) demonstrated
#' that networks in this regime show the weakest statistical evidence for edge
#' presence or absence, yielding unstable parameter estimates (n = 28 excluded).
#' This left n = 194 networks for analysis. Shape and scale parameters were
#' modelled on their original scales.
#'
#' The two equations have an asymmetric structure. Shape — which governs the
#' concentration of the edge weight distribution — is predicted from \code{snr}
#' and \code{rlp} only, reflecting that the shape of the distribution is a
#' property of the network's signal structure independent of sampling precision.
#' Scale — which governs typical edge weight magnitude — additionally includes
#' \code{scaling}, as the expected size of partial correlations is directly
#' affected by estimation precision. Dropping \code{scaling} from the shape
#' equation costs \eqn{\Delta R^2 < 0.006} and yields cleaner inference; all
#' shape predictors are significant under HC3-robust standard errors
#' (both \eqn{p < 0.001}).
#'
#' Variance inflation factors for the scale equation (\eqn{\leq} 1.60)
#' confirmed the absence of problematic multicollinearity; the shape equation
#' contains only two predictors with no multicollinearity concern.
#' Breusch-Pagan tests indicated statistically significant heteroskedasticity
#' in both equations; however, all predictors remained significant under
#' HC3-robust standard errors, indicating no material effect on inference.
#' Shape residuals were normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.990,
#' p = 0.173). Scale residuals showed a modest departure from normality
#' (Shapiro-Wilk W = 0.973, p < 0.001), consistent with slight right skew
#' in the scale outcome and test sensitivity at n = 194 rather than a
#' substantive violation, as confirmed by visual inspection of the residual
#' histogram. Model fit was strong: shape \eqn{R^2 = 0.887} (RMSE = 0.048);
#' scale \eqn{R^2 = 0.885} (RMSE = 0.011).
