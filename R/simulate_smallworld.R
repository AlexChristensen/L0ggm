#' Simulates Small-World GGM Data
#'
#' @description
#' Simulates data from a Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) with a small-world
#' network structure. The generative process proceeds in three stages. First,
#' a ring lattice is constructed with \code{neighbors + 1} nearest-neighbor
#' connections per node, where \code{neighbors} is derived from \code{nodes}
#' and \code{density}. Second, the lattice is randomly pruned to the target
#' \code{density}, introducing degree heterogeneity from the outset. Third,
#' edges are rewired with probability \code{rewire}, where rewired edges are
#' placed preferentially on node pairs with higher combined degree (degree-
#' weighted rewiring). This approach produces more realistic degree
#' distributions than standard Watts-Strogatz rewiring while preserving
#' the local clustering structure of the lattice. Edge weights are assigned
#' by structural priority: edges retained from the pruned lattice receive
#' larger partial correlation weights based on their original neighbor
#' distance, grounded in the empirical observation that shorter-distance
#' connections tend to carry stronger weights in psychometric networks.
#' The resulting network is used to generate multivariate normal (or skewed)
#' data. Parameters do not have default values (except
#' \code{negative_proportion}, \code{snr}, \code{target_condition},
#' \code{max_correlation}, and \code{max_iterations}) and must each be set.
#' See Details and Examples to get started.
#'
#' @param nodes Numeric (length = 1).
#' Number of nodes in the network.
#' Minimum of three nodes. The total number of nodes should be between 8
#' and 54 to remain within the range of the empirical networks used to fit
#' the Weibull parameter model; values outside this range are accepted but
#' will trigger extrapolation and may produce a warning from
#' \code{\link{weibull_parameters}}.
#'
#' @param density Numeric (length = 1).
#' Target edge density of the network after pruning the initial ring lattice.
#' Controls the number of nearest neighbors \code{k} each node is connected
#' to via \eqn{k = \mathrm{round}((\text{nodes} \times
#' \frac{\text{nodes}-1}{2} \times \text{density}) / \text{nodes})}, subject
#' to a minimum of 2 and a maximum of
#' \eqn{\lfloor (\text{nodes}-1)/2 \rfloor}. A ring lattice with
#' \code{neighbors + 1} connections per node is first generated and then
#' pruned to this density, introducing degree heterogeneity before rewiring.
#' Must be between 0 and 1. A minimum density sufficient to maintain a
#' connected graph is enforced; values below this threshold will produce an
#' informative error.
#'
#' @param rewire Numeric (length = 1).
#' Probability of rewiring each edge. Unlike the standard Watts-Strogatz
#' model, rewired edges are placed using degree-weighted random selection:
#' node pairs with higher combined degree have a greater probability of
#' receiving a rewired edge (see Details). Values near 0 preserve the
#' pruned lattice structure; values near 1 produce approximately random
#' networks. The small-world regime typically occurs at intermediate values
#' (roughly 0.01 to 0.30). Must be between 0 and 1.
#'
#' @param snr Numeric (length = 1).
#' Signal-to-noise ratio of the absolute partial correlation weights,
#' defined as \eqn{\bar{|w|} / \mathrm{SD}(|w|)}. Values less than 1
#' produce wider, more heterogeneous weight distributions; values greater
#' than 1 produce narrower, more homogeneous distributions. Empirically
#' observed SNR values ranged from 0.648 to 1.712; values outside this
#' range are accepted but will trigger a warning. Defaults to \code{1}.
#'
#' @param negative_proportion Numeric (length = 1).
#' Proportion of edges that are negative (inhibitory).
#' Must be between 0 and 0.50. The upper bound of 0.50 is a mathematical
#' constraint of the sign-flipping procedure used to assign negative edges
#' (see Details). If not provided, a value is sampled from a truncated
#' normal distribution reflecting the empirical distribution of true
#' negative partial correlations across 194 psychometric networks:
#' mean = 0.34, SD = 0.086, bounded to \eqn{[0.083, 0.50]}.
#'
#' @param sample_size Numeric (length = 1).
#' Number of observations to generate from the population multivariate
#' normal distribution. Also influences the predicted Weibull scale
#' parameter via \code{\link{weibull_parameters}}: larger samples are
#' associated with smaller, more precisely estimated edge weights.
#'
#' @param skew Numeric (length = 1 or \code{nodes}).
#' Skew applied to each variable after generation from the multivariate
#' normal. Can be a single value (applied to all variables) or one value
#' per variable. Values are rounded to the nearest increment of 0.05 in
#' the range \eqn{[-2, 2]}. Defaults to \code{0} (no skew).
#'
#' @param skew_range Numeric (length = 2).
#' If provided, a skew value is drawn uniformly from this range for each
#' variable, overriding \code{skew}. Both values must be between -2 and 2.
#'
#' @param target_condition Numeric (length = 1).
#' Target condition number (using \code{\link{kappa}} with \code{exact =
#' TRUE}) applied when ridge regularization is needed to recover a positive
#' definite precision matrix. The smallest ridge penalty \eqn{\lambda} that
#' brings the condition number to this target is found via root-finding
#' (\code{\link{uniroot}}), subject to a maximum shrinkage of approximately
#' 23\% following Peeters et al. (2020). Lower values produce
#' better-conditioned matrices. Defaults to \code{30}. Values up to
#' \code{100} are accepted but not recommended.
#'
#' @param max_correlation Numeric (length = 1).
#' Maximum allowed absolute pairwise correlation in the population
#' correlation matrix \code{R}. Any draw where
#' \code{max(abs(R[lower.tri(R)])) > max_correlation} is rejected and a
#' new attempt is made. Must be between 0 and 1. Defaults to \code{0.80}.
#'
#' @param max_iterations Numeric (length = 1).
#' Maximum number of attempts to find (1) a connected network structure,
#' (2) a network satisfying the small-world screening criterion, and (3) a
#' valid set of edge weights. The error message reports a frequency table
#' of rejection reasons to assist with diagnosing convergence failures.
#' Defaults to \code{100}.

#' @details
#' \strong{Lattice generation and pruning}
#'
#' The generative process begins by constructing a ring lattice with
#' \code{neighbors + 1} nearest-neighbor connections per node via
#' \code{\link[igraph]{sample_smallworld}} with \code{p = 0}. The
#' \code{+1} overshoot ensures the lattice always has more edges than the
#' target density, guaranteeing that pruning can proceed. The lattice is
#' then randomly pruned to the target \code{density} by removing edges
#' uniformly at random, subject to the constraint that the pruned graph
#' remains connected. Because removal is random, different nodes lose
#' different numbers of edges, producing a heterogeneous degree distribution
#' before any rewiring occurs. This heterogeneity provides a non-uniform
#' prior for the subsequent degree-weighted rewiring step.
#'
#' \strong{Degree-weighted rewiring}
#'
#' Each edge in the pruned lattice is independently selected for rewiring
#' with probability \code{rewire}. For each selected edge \eqn{(i, j)},
#' node \eqn{i} is kept fixed and the \eqn{j} endpoint is redirected to a
#' new target node. Valid targets are restricted to node pairs involving
#' node \eqn{i} that (1) are not currently connected, and (2) have never
#' been occupied during the current rewiring pass (i.e., were absent in
#' the original pruned lattice). Among valid targets, the new endpoint is
#' selected with probability proportional to \eqn{\sqrt{d_i + d_k}}, where
#' \eqn{d_i} and \eqn{d_k} are the current degrees of the two nodes in
#' the candidate pair. The square-root transformation moderates the
#' rich-get-richer tendency of linear preferential attachment, producing
#' degree heterogeneity consistent with the empirical range of psychometric
#' networks without generating extreme hubs. Node degrees are updated
#' incrementally after each rewire so that subsequent rewiring steps
#' reflect the current graph state.
#'
#' \strong{Edge weight assignment}
#'
#' Edge weights are assigned by ranking edges according to their distance
#' in the pruned lattice before rewiring. Edges retained from the pruned
#' lattice receive their original neighbor distance (1 = nearest neighbor,
#' 2 = second nearest, etc.); rewired edges are assigned a distance of
#' \code{neighbors + 1}, placing them at the bottom of the priority order.
#' Absolute edge weights are drawn from a Weibull distribution whose
#' parameters are predicted from the network size, sample size, and signal-
#' to-noise ratio using a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) model fitted
#' to 194 empirical psychometric networks (Huth et al., 2025). The sorted
#' (descending) Weibull weights are then mapped onto the distance ranking
#' so that the largest weights go to the shortest-distance edges. This
#' assignment is grounded in the empirical observation that shorter-distance
#' local connections tend to carry larger partial correlation weights in
#' psychometric networks.
#'
#' \strong{Negative edge assignment}
#'
#' Negative edges are introduced by flipping the signs of a subset of
#' nodes — multiplying all edges incident to those nodes by -1. The number
#' of nodes to flip is derived from \code{negative_proportion} via the
#' inversion formula \eqn{(1 - \sqrt{1 - 2p}) / 2}, where \eqn{p} is the
#' target proportion of negative edges. This formula assumes that an edge
#' is negative if and only if exactly one of its endpoints is flipped,
#' giving an expected negative proportion of \eqn{2 \cdot (k/n) \cdot
#' (1 - k/n)} for \eqn{k} flipped nodes out of \eqn{n} total. The formula
#' requires \eqn{p \leq 0.50}, which is why \code{negative_proportion} is
#' bounded at 0.50.
#'
#' \strong{Small-worldness screening}
#'
#' Each generated adjacency structure is screened using the omega statistic
#' (Telesford et al., 2011): \eqn{\omega = (L_r / L) - (C / C_l)}, where
#' \eqn{L} is the average shortest path length (ASPL) of the network,
#' \eqn{L_r} is the expected ASPL of a random graph with the same degree
#' sequence, \eqn{C} is the average clustering coefficient, and \eqn{C_l}
#' is the clustering coefficient of the pruned lattice (before rewiring).
#' Networks with \eqn{|\omega| > 0.80} are rejected. The random-graph ASPL
#' \eqn{L_r} is computed analytically via Equation 54 of Newman, Strogatz,
#' and Watts (2001):
#' \eqn{L_r = \ln(N / z_1) / \ln(z_2 / z_1) + 1}, where \eqn{z_1} is the
#' mean degree and \eqn{z_2 = \overline{k^2} - \overline{k}} is the mean
#' number of second neighbors, when the conditions \eqn{N > z_1} and
#' \eqn{z_2 > z_1} are satisfied. When these conditions are not met, a
#' simulation-based estimate using \code{iter = 100} degree-sequence-matched
#' random graphs is used as a fallback. Note that the lattice clustering
#' reference \eqn{C_l} is computed from the pruned lattice rather than from
#' an idealized regular ring, which is internally consistent with the
#' data generating process.

#' @return A named list with four elements:
#'

#' To produce ordinal data, pass the columns through
#' \code{\link{categorize}}.}

#'   recoverable community structure in the network rather than the result

#'   structure, consistent with the network theory of psychopathology.
